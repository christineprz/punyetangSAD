				<p style="font-size: 20px;  font-family: 'trebuchet ms'; text-align: justify;">	The chapel of San Jose is a fruit of years of labor from the elders of the locality who desire to have the mass in their place. The people of Ampid used to join Baranggay Santa Ana in their Fiesta.</p>
                <p style="font-size:20px;  font-family: 'trebuchet ms'; text-align: justify;"> In 1982 the old chapel was rebuilt under the leadership of the couple, Mariano "Nano" Cruz and Isidra "Sidra" Cruz. The chapel they led to build became the foundation of the new quasi parish in 1998.</p>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: 'trebuchet ms'; text-align: justify">The history of the parish began with the appointment of Fr. Gerald as the priest in-charge of a chapel in Ampid 1 on July 28, 1998. He rented a house in Bancom Subdivision on August 2, 1998. The first mass was celebrated on August 19, 1998, a day after the “Lakbay Dalaw” of the Our Lady of Aranzazu Image visited Ampid.
					<br><br>The Decree of establishing the Quasi Parish of San Jose was issued on March 26, 1999 by Bishop Protacio Gungon, D.D. This formally separates San Jose Quasi Parish from the mother parish of Nuestra Senora de Aranzazu. On April 4, 1999, the reconstruction of the 256 sq. m. church began, under the supervision of Architech Peter “Jun” Fetalvero who volunteered his services. On May 12, 1999, Bishop Protacio Gungon led the formal ground breaking ceremonies and on July 10, 1999, a temporary church was built at the IPM compound owned by Jun Mercado, just across the road where the church is located; the old chapel was completely leveled down to give way to a two-storey church building for the new quasi parish. The church building was reoccupied fifteen minutes after midnight on January 1, 2000. Finishing touches were done since.
					<br><br>The quasi parish is also proud to be the only quasi parish in the history of the diocese to give birth to another quasi parish. On July 31, 2002, the Santo Nino de Aguador Quasi Parish in Modesta was born from the territorial boundaries of San Jose Quasi Parish. On November 9, 2002, Bishop Crisostomo Yalung, D.D. erected the quasi parisn into a parish, installing Fr. Gerald G. Metal as its first parish priest. San Jose Parish is now building a bigger house of worship located in Rafaela 2 subdivision. The first mass and ground breaking ceremony were held there last December 15, 2002.</p>
